  <i> Several people were deeply moved by the scene in which Seymour's father, Les, asked him "if he remembered the time Joe Jackson had given him, Seymour, a ride on the handlebars of his bicycle, all over the stage, around and around." Seymour "replied gravely and at once, and in the special way he always answered questions from Les - as if they were the questions, above all others, he preferred to be asked in his life. He said he wasn't sure he had ever got off Joe Jackson's beautiful bicycle. And aside from its enourmous sentimental value to my father personally, this answer, in a great many ways, was true, true, true."

  Don, in contrast to others in the group, thought this scene was much too sentimental. I was startled by the centainty of his conviction that the scene was wrong, and I recall clearly that it was at that moment that I became aware of how completely he resisted the sentimental in his own writing. </i>
